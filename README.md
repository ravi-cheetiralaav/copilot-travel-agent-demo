## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18.x or later (LTS recommended). On Windows we recommend using **nvm-windows** to manage Node versions: https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows
- npm (bundled with Node) or `yarn` if you prefer
- Git (for cloning)
- Optional: Docker & Docker Compose if you prefer containerized development

### Installation (Windows PowerShell)

1. Clone the repository and enter the project directory:

```powershell
git clone <repository-url>
Set-Location -Path copilot-agent-demo
```

2. Install Node (if not already installed)

Using `nvm-windows` (recommended):

```powershell
# Install nvm-windows from https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows/releases
# Then install and use Node 18 (example):
nvm install 18.20.0
nvm use 18.20.0
```

3. Install dependencies:

```powershell
npm install
# or
 yarn install
```

4. Start the development server (PowerShell):

```powershell
npm run dev
```

5. Open the app in your browser: `http://localhost:3000`

### Optional: Docker (Windows)

If you prefer running the app with Docker Compose (development profile mounts the source for hot reload):

```powershell
# Development (hot-reload) - uses the `dev` profile
docker-compose --profile dev up --build travel-app-dev

# Production-like build
docker-compose up --build
```

Notes:
- When using Docker on Windows, ensure file sharing / volume mounts are enabled and your Docker resources (CPU/RAM) are sufficient for a Next.js dev server.
- The repository provides `Dockerfile` and `Dockerfile.dev` for production and development images respectively.

## Docker Support

### Quick Start with Docker

Run the application using Docker Compose:

```bash
# Build and run production version
docker-compose up --build

# Run development version with hot-reloading
docker-compose --profile dev up --build travel-app-dev
```

### Manual Docker Commands

```bash
# Build the Docker image
docker build -t travel-app .

# Run the container
docker run -p 3000:3000 travel-app

# For development with hot-reloading
docker build -f Dockerfile.dev -t travel-app-dev .
docker run -p 3000:3000 -v $(pwd):/app -v /app/node_modules travel-app-dev
```

### GitHub Package Registry

The application is automatically built and pushed to GitHub Package Registry on:
- Push to `main` or `develop` branches
- Tagged releases
- Pull requests to `main`

Pull the latest image:
```bash
docker pull ghcr.io/ravi-cheetiralaav/copilot-agent-demo:main
```
